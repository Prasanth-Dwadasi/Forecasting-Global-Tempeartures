# Forecasting Global Temperature

Analyzed the behavior of global temperature from 1850 – 2020 and forecasted temperature for the next 25 years.

Predicted the global temperature increase accurately to reach 2°C by 2051 as proposed by IPCC if current pollution levels continue.

# Overview

- Gathered temperature and pollution data since 1850 multiples sources from multiple sources
- Merged, Cleaned and prepared for Time series Forecasting
- Used ARIMA from stats.models for univariate Forecasting
- Used VAR from stats.models for multivariate Forecasting
